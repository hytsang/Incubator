## About the data

The data is publicly available from National Center of Education Statistics ([NCES](http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/deltacostproject/)). The Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) data includes includes academic years from 19887 through 2012. The data derived from the institutional characteristics, finance, enrollment, completions, graduation rates, student financial aid, and human resources IPEDS survey components and a limited number of outside sources. The database contains one observation per institution for each year of data that is available; it includes all institutions that reported institutional characteristic data to IPEDS in the fall of each academic year. 

To allow for trends analyses that are not affected by institutions entering or leaving the dataset, the database includes variables to identify panels of institutions that report data consistently over specified time periods. These institutional panels are referred to as “matched sets.” To be included in the matched set, an institution must have data on three measures—fall full-time equivalent (FTE) student enrollment, instructional expenditures, and student completions—for every year in the panel time period. There are three different matched sets that cover different time periods: 1987-2012, 2002-2012, and 2007-2012.
